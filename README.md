# Hi.

This repo demos an issue when using the Fractal logger together with Gulp (4).

The logger seems to convince Gulp that the watch task didnâ€™t finish correctly,
resulting in the following output:

```
[16:01:59] Using gulpfile ~/Development/projects/gulptest-fractallogger/gulpfile.js
[16:01:59] Starting 'watch'...
^C
[16:02:00] The following tasks did not complete: watch
[16:02:00] Did you forget to signal async completion?
```

Run `npm install`, then `npm run gulp`, then exit the process with ctrl+c
to see the issue.
